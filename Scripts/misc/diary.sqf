//-------------------------------------------------- FAQ

player createDiaryRecord ["faq",
[
"UAVs",
"
<br /> In the Control Tower at base, a UAV Operator can now recycle the UAV crew on one of the computer terminals.
<br /><br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Can I use the UAVs?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Yes, however you must be in the UAV Operator role and you must have a UAV Terminal.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why do the UAVs keep exploding?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> When the bomb-equipped UAVs are first connected to, the Gunner AI fires its weapons. Until it's fixed, here is a guide for you.<br />
<br /> To safely connect to the MQ4A Greyhawk UAV:<br />
<br />	1. Enter action menu (mouse scroll), click 'Open UAV Terminal'.
<br />	2. Right-click on the UAV you wish to control, on the terminal map.
<br />	3. Click 'Connect Terminal to UAV'.
<br /><br /> [IMPORTANT] Do NOT click 'Take Control' button in UAV Terminal.<br />
<br />	4. Esc out of the UAV terminal.
<br />	5. Enter action menu (mouse scroll) again.
<br />	6. [IMPORTANT] Select 'Take UAV TURRET controls'.<br />
<br />
<br />	It is now safe to 'Take Control' of the UAV.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why can't I connect to the UAV?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Sometimes the UAVs are still connected to the prior Operators Terminal. If he disconnects or dies, sometimes the Terminal does not delete properly. The only solution at this time is to destroy the UAV, and you yourself must respawn.

"Squads",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> How do I join or create a squad?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> 
<br /> 1. Press 'U' to open BI Squad Management.
<br /> 2. If you receive a squad invite from another player, hold 'U' to accept it.
<br />
<br /> * Xeno's Squad Management tool had to be removed at request of the script author. Engine-based BI Squad Management is being used now.

"Medics",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why can't I heal him?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> There are three conditions you must pass in order to revive a fallen comrade. 
<br /> 1. You must be in a Medic / Paramedic role.
<br /> 2. You must have a Medkit.
<br /> 3. You must have at least one First Aid Kit.

"Mortars",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Can I use the Mortars?
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Yes, However if you are not in the mortar gunner role you will not have acess to the Artillery Computer.<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> How do I use the Mortar without the computer?
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> You have to manually find the target with the sight. Here are some steps to use the mortar. 
<br /> 1. Press the F key to select the firing distance.
<br /> 2. If you are in line-of-sight just put the cursor on the target and use the page up and page down keys to change the elevation.
<br /> 3. Fire!<br />
